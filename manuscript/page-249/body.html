It wasn't here yesterday, so that means that he is at work right around here now. Hello, I thought so!‚Äù</p><p>Peter had been looking along that little ridge and had discovered that it ended only a short distance from him. Now as he looked at it again, he saw the flat surface of the ground at the end of the ridge rise as if being pushed up from beneath, and that little ridge became just so much longer. Peter understood perfectly. Out of sight beneath the surface Miner the Mole was at work. He was digging a tunnel, and that ridge was simply the roof to that tunnel. It was so near the surface of the ground that Miner simply pushed up the loose soil as he bored his way along, and this made the little ridge over which Peter had stumbled.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Peter watched a few minutes, then turned and scampered, lipperty-lipperty-lip, for the Green Forest.</p></div> </div>

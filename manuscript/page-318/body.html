If I couldn't, I guess I would go hungry most of the time,” replied Little Joe.</p><p>“Why should you go hungry? Paddy doesn't,” retorted Peter.</p><p>“Paddy doesn't live on fish,” replied Little Joe. “I do and that's the difference. I can catch a fish in a tail-end race, and that's going some.”</p><p>“You might show us how you can swim,” suggested Old Mother Nature.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Little Joe slipped into the water.

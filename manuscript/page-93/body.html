In some parts of the country there are members of his family who prefer to live just on the edge of the Green Forest. You will notice that Johnny has stout claws. Those are to help him dig, for all the Marmot family are great diggers. What other use do you have for those claws, Johnny?”</p><p>“They help me to climb,” replied Johnny promptly.</p><p>“Climb!” exclaimed Peter Rabbit. “Who ever heard of a Woodchuck climbing?”</p><p>“I can climb if I have to,” retorted Johnny Chuck indignantly. “I've climbed up bushes and low trees lots of times, and if I can get a good run first, I can climb up the straight trunk of a tree with rough bark to the first branches—if they are not too far above ground. You ask Reddy Fox if I can't; he knows.”</p></div> </div>

He dearly loves a fat beetle. He likes meat when he can get it.”</p><p>“Where does he make his home?” Peter inquired.</p><p>“Usually in a hole in a tree,” said Old Mother Nature. “He is very fond of an old home of a Woodpecker. He makes a comfortable nest of bark lining, grass, and moss, or any other soft material he can find. Occasionally he builds an outside nest high up in a fork in the branches of a tree. He likes to get into old buildings.”</p><p>“Does he have many enemies?” asked Happy Jack.</p><p>“The same enemies the rest of you have,” replied Old Mother Nature. “But the one he has most reason to fear is Hooty the Owl, and that is the one you have least reason to fear, because Hooty seldom hunts by day.”</p></div> </div>

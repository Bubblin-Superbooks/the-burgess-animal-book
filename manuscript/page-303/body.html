<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">fellow like you running from such a little fellow as my Cousin Shadow!”</p><p>“I'm not ashamed of running,” declared Jumper. “I may be ever so much bigger, but he is so quick I wouldn't stand the least chance in the world. When I suspect Shadow is about, I go somewhere else, the farther the better. If I could climb a tree like Chatterer, it would be different.”</p><p>“No, it wouldn't!” interrupted Chatterer. “No, it wouldn't. That fellow can climb almost as well as I can. The only thing that saved me from him once was the fact that I could make a long jump from one tree to another and he couldn't. He had found a hole in a certain tree where I was living, and it was just luck that I wasn't at home when he called. I was just returning when he popped out. I ran for my life.”</p><p>“He is the most awful fellow in all the Great World,” declared Whitefoot the Wood Mouse.</p></div> </div>

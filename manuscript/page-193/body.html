Of course you will be there.”</p><p>“Of course,” replied Danny in the most matter-of-fact tone. “Of course. If Old Mother Nature really sent me that message—”</p><p>“She really did,” interrupted Peter.</p><p>“There isn't anything for me to do but obey,” finished Danny. Then his face became very sober. “That is a long way for me to go, Peter,” said he. “I wouldn't take such a long journey for anything or for anybody else. Old Mother Nature knows, and if she sent for me she must be sure I can make the trip safely. What time did you say I must be there?”</p><p>“At sun-up,” replied Peter. “Shall I call for you on my way there?”</p><p>Danny shook his head. Then he began to laugh. “What are you laughing at?” demanded Peter.</p></div> </div>

Since he is underground, it doesn't make much difference to him whether it be night or day. In summer, during the hottest part of the day, he rests.

He has a funny little tail without any hair on it; this is very sensitive and serves him as a sort of guide when he runs backward along his tunnel, which he can do quite fast. A funny thing about those long claws on his front feet is that he folds them under when he is walking or running. Do any of you know why Farmer Brown plows his garden?”</p></div> </div>
